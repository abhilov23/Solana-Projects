# cruddapp - Solana CRUD Application

Welcome to `cruddapp`, a decentralized CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built on the Solana blockchain using Anchor. This project demonstrates a simple journal entry system where users can create, update, and delete entries stored on-chain, with each entry tied to a Program Derived Address (PDA) based on a title and owner. It serves as a learning tool for Solana development and can be extended for real-world use cases like logging or data management.

## Overview
`cruddapp` is a Solana program written in Rust with Anchor, providing a TypeScript/JavaScript interface for frontend integration. It uses PDAs to uniquely identify journal entries based on a title and owner public key. The frontend leverages React hooks with `@tanstack/react-query` for state management and `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` for wallet interactions, though it can be adapted to use stored keys for signing.

This project is ideal for developers learning Anchor, Solana program development, and frontend integration, with a focus on on-chain data persistence.

## Features
- **Create Entries**: Store new journal entries with a title and message, linked to the ownerâ€™s public key.
- **Read Entries**: Fetch all or specific journal entries stored on-chain.
- **Update Entries**: Modify the message of an existing entry.
- **Delete Entries**: Remove entries from the blockchain.
- **PDA-based Storage**: Uses Program Derived Addresses for unique entry identification.
- **React Integration**: Provides custom hooks for querying and mutating data.
